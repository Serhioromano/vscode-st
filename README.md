# Structured Text (IEC 61131-3)

Most complete Structured Text language support.

## Syntax Highlights

Includes syntax highlight based on IEC 61131-3 draft, including namespaces, SFC elements (STEP, ACTION, TRANSITION), constant variables (2#000_1010, 16#1E, INT#23) and more.

## Snippets

Fast growing snippets library. All cycles, conditions and declarations.

## Commands

Can automatically capitalize constants like `TRUE`, `FALSE`. Either use command `ST: Format` from command pallet, of from editor context menu. There is also user setting `st.autoFormat` which is set `true` by default, you can turn it off.

## Note

- The same Author contributed ST support for Monaco Editor and highlight.js.
- This extension project is a part of my "Structured Text Bible" book which I am working on right now.

## Roadmap
